# This file contains the list of officially endorsed plugins.

# Note that the plugins below reference "/master/" in their
# url; this isn't what gets actually fetch. We replace this
# part at runtime by "@yarnpkg/cli/X.Y.Z", where X.Y.Z is
# the version of the CLI running `yarn plugin import`.
#
# As a result, even if these files don't technically exist
# on our repository anymore, they'll still get properly
# fetched by Yarn 3.x users.
