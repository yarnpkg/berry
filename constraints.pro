% This file is written in Prolog
% It contains rules that the project must respect.
% In order to see them in action, run `yarn constraints source`	

% This rule will enforce that a workspace MUST depend on the same version of a dependency as the one used by the other workspaces

    workspace_has_dependency(OtherWorkspaceCwd, DependencyIdent, DependencyRange2, DependencyType2),
  % Ignore peer dependencies
    DependencyType \= 'peerDependencies',
    DependencyType2 \= 'peerDependencies'.

% This rule will prevent workspaces from depending on non-workspace versions of available workspaces

  % Obtain the version from the dependency
