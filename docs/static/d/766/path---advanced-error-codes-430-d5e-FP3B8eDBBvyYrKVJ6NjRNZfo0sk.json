Please relinquish one character and use the <code>BRX+3</code> prefix instead of <code>BR+4</code>! it will make it clear to our users which error codes can be found on this documentation and which ones should instead be checked against the documentation of the plugins they use.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>BR0000 - <code>UNNAMED</code></h2>\n<p>This code is used to log regular messages, mostly to align all the lines in the Yarn output. No worry!</p>\n<h2>BR0001 - <code>EXCEPTION</code></h2>\n<p>An exception had be thrown by the program.</p>\n<p>This error typically should never happen (it should instead point to a different error message from this page so that it can be properly documented), so it should be considered a bug in Yarn. Feel free to open an issue or, even better, a pull request aiming to fix it.</p>\n<h2>BR0002 - <code>MISSING_PEER_DEPENDENCY</code></h2>\n<p>A package requests a peer dependency, but its parent in the dependency tree doesn't provide it.</p>\n<p>This error occurs when a package peer dependencies cannot be satisfied. If the peer dependency is optional and shouldn't trigger such warnings, then mark it as such using the <a href=\"\">optional peer dependencies</a> feature.</p>\n<p>Note that Yarn enforces peer dependencies at every level of the dependency tree - meaning that if <code>A</code> depends on <code>(B,X)</code> and <code>B</code> depends on <code>C</code> and <code>C</code> has a peer dependency on <code>X</code>, then a warning will be emitted (because <code>B</code> doesn't fulfill the peer dependendy request). The best way to solve this is to explicitly list the transitive peer dependency on <code>X</code> in <code>B</code> has well.</p>\n<h2>BR0003 - <code>CYCLIC_DEPENDENCIES</code></h2>\n<p>Two packages with build scripts have cyclic dependencies.</p>\n<p>Cyclic dependencies are a can of worm. They happen when a package <code>A</code> depends on a package <code>B</code> and vice-versa (they sometime can be spread across multiple packages - for example <code>A</code> depends on <code>B</code> which depends on <code>C</code> which depends on <code>A</code>).</p>\n<p>While they may work fine in the general case (and in fact Berry won't warn you about it in most cases), they cause issues as soon as build scripts are involved. Indeed, in order to build a package, we first must make sure that its own dependencies have been properly built. How can we do that when two packages reference each other? Since it cannot be deduced, such patterns will cause the build scripts of every affected packages to simply be ignored.</p>\n<p>There's already good documentation online explaining how to get rid of cyclic dependencies, the simplest one being to extract the shared part of your program into a third package without dependencies. So the first case we described would become <code>A</code> depends on <code>C</code>, <code>B</code> depends on <code>C</code>, <code>C</code> doesn't depend on anything.</p>\n<h2>BR0004 - <code>DISABLED_BUILD_SCRIPTS</code></h2>\n<p>A package has build scripts, but they've been disabled across the project.</p>\n<p>Build scripts can be disabled on a global basis through the use of the <code>enable-scripts</code> settings. When it happens, a warning is still emitted to let you know that the installation might not be complete.</p>\n<p>The safest way to downgrade the warning into a notification is to explicitly disable build scripts for the affected packages through the use of the <code>dependenciesMeta[].build</code> key.</p>\n<h2>BR0005 - <code>BUILD_DISABLED</code></h2>\n<p>A package has build scripts, but they've been disabled through its configuration.</p>\n<p>Build scripts can be disabled on a per-project basis through the use of the <code>dependenciesMeta</code> settings from the <code>package.json</code> file. When it happens, a notification is still emitted to let you know that the installation might not be complete.</p>\n<h2>BR0006 - <code>SOFT_LINK_BUILD</code></h2>\n<p>A package has build scripts, but is linked through a soft link.</p>\n<p>For Yarn, a hard link is when a package is owned by the package manager. In these instances Yarn will typically copy packages having build scripts into a project-local cache so that multiple projects with multiple dependency trees don't use the same build artifacts. So what's the problem with so-called \"soft links\"?</p>\n<p>Soft links are when the package manager doesn't own the package source. An example is a workspace, or a dependency referenced through the <code>portal:</code> specifier. In these instances Yarn cannot safely assume that executing build scripts there is the intended behavior, because it would likely involve mutating your project or, even worse, an external location on your disk that might be shared by multiple projects. Since Yarn avoids doing anything unsafe, it cannot run build scripts on soft links.</p>\n<p>There are a few workarounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Using <code>file:</code> instead of <code>portal:</code> will cause a hard link to be used instead of a soft link. The other side of the coin will be that the packages will be copied into the cache as well, meaning that changing the package source will require you to run <code>YARN_UPDATE_FILE_CACHE=1 yarn install</code> for your changes to be taken into account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can manually run <code>yarn run postinstall</code> (or whatever is named your build script) from the directory of the affected packages. This requires you to know in which order they'll have to be called, but is generally the safest option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can simply abstain from using build scripts with soft links. While this suggestion might seem like a bad case of \"fix a problem by not encountering the problem\", consider that build scripts in development might not be of the best effect from a developer experience perspective - they usually mean that you'll need to run a script before being able to see your changes, which is often not what you seek.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>BR0007 - <code>MUST_BUILD</code></h2>\n<p>A package must be built.</p>\n<p>This informational message occurs when Yarn wishes to let you know that a package will need to be built in order for the installation to complete. This usually occurs in only two cases: either the package never has been built before, or its previous build failed (returned a non-zero exit code).</p>\n<h2>BR0008 - <code>MUST_REBUILD</code></h2>\n<p>A package must be rebuilt.</p>\n<p>This information message occurs when Yarn wishes to let you know that a package will need to be rebuilt in order for the installation to complete. This usually occurs in a single case: when the package's dependency tree has changed. Note that this also include its transitive dependencies, which sometimes may cause surprising rebuilds (for example, if <code>A</code> depends on <code>B</code> that depends on <code>C@1</code>, and if Yarn decides for some reason that <code>C</code> should be bumped to <code>C@2</code>, then <code>A</code> will need to be rebuilt).</p>\n<h2>BR0009 - <code>BUILD_FAILED</code></h2>\n<p>A package build failed.</p>\n<p>This problem typically doesn't come from Yarn itself, and simply means that a package described as having build directives couldn't get built successfully.</p>\n<p>To see the actual error message, read the file linked in the report. It will contain the full output of the failing script.</p>\n<h2>BR0010 - <code>RESOLVER_NOT_FOUND</code></h2>\n<p>A resolver cannot be found for the given package.</p>\n<p>Resolvers are the components tasked from converting ranges (<code>^1.0.0</code>) into references (<code>1.2.3</code>). They each contain their own logic to do so - the semver resolver is the most famous one but far from being the only one. The GitHub resolver transforms GitHub repositories into tarball urls, the Git resolver normalizes the paths sent to git, ... each resolver takes care of a different resolution strategy. A missing resolver means that one of those strategies is missing.</p>\n<p>This error is usually caused by a Yarn plugin being missing.</p>\n<h2>BR0011 - <code>FETCHER_NOT_FOUND</code></h2>\n<p>A fetcher cannot be found for the given package.</p>\n<p>Fetchers are the components that take references and fetch the source code from the remote location. A semver fetcher would likely fetch the packages from some registry, while a workspace fetcher would simply redirect to the location on the disk where the sources can be found.</p>\n<p>This error is usually caused by a Yarn plugin being missing.</p>\n<h2>BR0012 - <code>LINKER_NOT_FOUND</code></h2>\n<p>A linker cannot be found for the given package.</p>\n<p>Linkers are the components tasked from extracting the sources from the artifacts returned by the fetchers and putting them on the disk in a manner that can be understood by the target environment. The Node linker would use the Plug'n'Play strategy, while a PHP linker would use an autoload strategy instead.</p>\n<p>This error is usually caused by a Yarn plugin being missing.</p>\n<h2>BR0013 - <code>FETCH_NOT_CACHED</code></h2>\n<p>A package cannot be found in the cache for the given package and will be fetched from its remote location.</p>\n<p>When a package is downloaded from whatever its remote location is, Yarn stores it in a specific folder called then cache. Then, the next time this package was to be downloaded, Yarn simply check this directory and use the stored package if available. This message simply means that the package couldn't be found there. It's not a huge issue, but you probably should try to limit it as much as possible - for example by using <a href=\"/berry/features/zero-installs\">Zero-Installs</a>.</p>\n<h2>BR0014 - <code>YARN_IMPORT_FAILED</code></h2>\n<p>A lockfile couldn't be properly imported from a v1 lockfile.</p>\n<p>The v2 release contains major changes in the way Yarn is design, and the lockfile format is one of them. In some rare cases, the data contained in the v1 lockfile aren't compatible with the ones we stored within the v2 files. When it happens, Yarn will emit this warning and resolve the package descriptor again. Only this package will be affected; all others will continue to be imported as expected.</p>\n<h2>BR0015 - <code>REMOTE_INVALID</code></h2>\n<p>The remote source returned invalid data.</p>\n<p>This error is thrown by the resolvers and fetchers when the remote sources they communicate with return values that aren't consistent with what we would expect (for example because they are missing fields).</p>\n<h2>BR0016 - <code>REMOTE_NOT_FOUND</code></h2>\n<p>The remote source returned valid data, but told us the package couldn't be found.</p>\n<p>This error is thrown by the resolvers and fetchers when the remote sources they communicate with inform them that the package against which have been made the request doesn't exist. This might happen if the package has been unpublished, and there's usually nothing Yarn can do.</p>\n<h2>BR0017 - <code>RESOLUTION_PACK</code></h2>\n<p>This error code isn't used at the moment (it used to print the number of packages that took part in each pass of the resolution algorithm, but was deemed too verbose compared to its usefulness).</p>\n<h2>BR0018 - <code>CACHE_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH</code></h2>\n<p>The checksum of a package from the cache doesn't match what the lockfile expects.</p>\n<p>This situation usually happens after you've modified the zip archives from your cache by editing the files it contains for debug purposes. Use one of the two following commands in order to bypass it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>YARN_CHECKSUM_BEHAVIOR=reset</code> will remove the files from the cache and download them again</li>\n<li><code>YARN_CHECKSUM_BEHAVIOR=update</code> will update the lockfile to contain the new checksum</li>\n<li><code>YARN_CHECKSUM_BEHAVIOR=ignore</code> will use the existing files but won't update the lockfile</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>BR0019 - <code>UNUSED_CACHE_ENTRY</code></h2>\n<p>A file from the cache has been detected unused by <code>yarn cache clean</code>.</p>\n<p>After removing or upgrading a dependency you'll find that Yarn won't automatically remove the now obsolete files from your cache (this is because your cache might be shared by multiple projects, and in order to keep the history less messy). Running <code>yarn cache clean</code> will cause Yarn to try to figure out which packages from the cache aren't referenced by the current lockfile.</p>\n<h2>BR0020 - <code>MISSING_LOCKFILE_ENTRY</code></h2>\n<p>A package descriptor cannot be found in the lockfile.</p>\n<p>A lot of commands (for example <code>yarn run</code>) require the lockfile to be in a state consistent with the current project in order to behave properly. This error will be generated when Yarn detects that your project references a package that isn't listed within the lockfile (usually because you modified a <code>dependencies</code> field without running <code>yarn install</code>, or because you added a new workspace). Running <code>yarn install</code> will almost certainly fix this particular error.</p>\n<h2>BR0021 - <code>WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND</code></h2>\n<p>A dependency uses a <code>workspace:</code> range that cannot be resolved to an existing workspace.</p>\n<p>The <code>workspace:</code> protocol is a new feature that appeared in Yarn v2 that allows to target a specific workspace of the current project without risking to ever pull data from other sources in case the workspace doesn't exist. This error precisely means that the workspace doesn't exist for the reason described in the error message.</p>\n<h2>BR0022 - <code>TOO_MANY_MATCHING_WORKSPACES</code></h2>\n<p>This error should be considered obsolete and not exist; open an issue if you have it.</p>\n<h2>BR0023 - <code>CONSTRAINTS_MISSING_DEPENDENCY</code></h2>\n<p>One of your workspaces should depend on a dependency but doesn't.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/berry/features/constraints\">constraint</a> has been put into effect that declares that the specified workspace must depend on the specified range of the specified dependency. Since it currently doesn't, Yarn emits this error when running <code>yarn constraints check</code>. In order to fix it simply run <code>yarn constraints fix</code> which will autofix all such errors.</p>\n<h2>BR0024 - <code>CONSTRAINTS_INCOMPATIBLE_DEPENDENCY</code></h2>\n<p>One of your workspaces should depend on a specific version of a dependency but doesn't.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/berry/features/constraints\">constraint</a> has been put into effect that declares that the specified workspace must depend on the specified range of the specified dependency. Since it currently doesn't, Yarn emits this error when running <code>yarn constraints check</code>. In order to fix it simply run <code>yarn constraints fix</code> which will autofix all such errors.</p>\n<h2>BR0025 - <code>CONSTRAINTS_EXTRANEOUS_DEPENDENCY</code></h2>\n<p>One of your workspaces shouldn't depend on one of the dependencies it lists.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/berry/features/constraints\">constraint</a> has been put into effect that declares that the specified workspace must depend on the specified range of the specified dependency. Since it currently doesn't, Yarn emits this error when running <code>yarn constraints check</code>. In order to fix it simply run <code>yarn constraints fix</code> which will autofix all such errors.</p>\n<h2>BR0026 - <code>CONSTRAINTS_INVALID_DEPENDENCY</code></h2>\n<p>One of your workspaces lists an invalid dependency.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/berry/features/constraints\">constraint</a> has been put into effect that declares that the specified workspace probably shouldn't depend on the specified dependency in its current state. Since it currently does, Yarn emits this error when running <code>yarn constraints check</code>. Fixing this error require manual intervention as the fix is ambiguous from Yarn's point of view.</p>\n<h2>BR0027 - <code>CANT_SUGGEST_RESOLUTIONS</code></h2>\n<p>Yarn cannot figure out proper range suggestions for the packages you're adding to your project.</p>\n<p>When running <code>yarn add</code> without adding explicit ranges to the packages to add, Yarn will try to find versions that match your intent. Generally it means that it will prefer project workspaces and, if it cannot find any, will instead try to query the npm registry for the list of published releases and use whatever is the highest one. This error means that this process failed and Yarn cannot successfully figure out which version of the package should be added to your project.</p>\n<h2>BR0028 - <code>FROZEN_LOCKFILE_EXCEPTION</code></h2>\n<p>Your lockfile would be modified if Yarn was to finish the install.</p>\n<p>When passing the <code>--frozen-lockfile</code> option to <code>yarn install</code>, Yarn will ensure that the lockfile isn't modified in the process and will instead throw an exception if this situation was to happen (for example if a newly added package was missing from the lockfile, or if the current Yarn release required some kind of migration before being able to work with the lockfile).</p>\n<p>This option is typically meant to be used on your CI and production servers, and fixing this error should simply be a matter of running <code>yarn install</code> on your local development environment and submitting a PR containing the updated lockfile.</p>\n<h2>BR0029 - <code>CROSS_DRIVE_VIRTUAL_LOCAL</code></h2>\n<p>The virtual package folder is located on a different disk than files referenced by your project.</p>\n<p>For technical reasons, and only on Windows, the virtual package folder (defined through the <code>virtualFolder</code> settings) usually cannot be set on a different drive than the files it references (which can potentially come from a whole variety of locations through the use of the <code>portal:</code> protocol, but usually come from either your cache and/or your project).</p>\n<p>To fix this, either move the virtual package folder to the same drive as the rest of your data or use the hidden <code>enableAbsoluteVirtuals</code> settings (this settings is hidden because it will cause Yarn to use absolute symlinks when generating the virtual links, which are likely to cause portability issues across systems and machines).</p>\n<h2>BR0030 - <code>FETCH_FAILED</code></h2>\n<p>This error code isn't used at the moment; we ideally want to explain <strong>why</strong> did the fetch fail rather than .</p>\n<h2>BR0031 - <code>DANGEROUS_NODE_MODULES</code></h2>\n<p>Yarn is installing packages using <a href=\"/berry/features/pnp\">Plug'n'Play</a>, but a <code>node_modules</code> folder has been found.</p>\n<p>This warning is emitted when your project is detected as containing <code>node_modules</code> folders that actually seem to contain packages. This is not advised as they're likely relicates of whatever package manager you used before, and might confuse your tools and lead you into \"works on my machine\" situations.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/advanced/error-codes","title":"Error Codes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"advanced"}}
