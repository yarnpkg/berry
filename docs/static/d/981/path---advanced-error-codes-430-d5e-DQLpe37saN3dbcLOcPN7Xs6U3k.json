They happen when a package <code>A</code> depends on a package <code>B</code> and vice-versa Sometime can arise through a chain of multiple packages - for example when <code>A</code> depends on <code>B</code>, which depends on <code>C</code>, which depends on <code>A</code>.</p>\n<p>While cyclic dependencies may work fine in the general Javascript case (and in fact Yarn won't warn you about it in most cases), they can cause issues as soon as build scripts are involved. Indeed, in order to build a package, we first must make sure that its own dependencies have been properly built. How can we do that when two packages reference each other? Since the first one to build cannot be deduced, such patterns will cause the build scripts of every affected packages to simply be ignored (and a warning emitted).</p>\n<p>There's already good documentation online explaining how to get rid of cyclic dependencies, the simplest one being to extract the shared part of your program into a third package without dependencies.

In these instances Yarn will typically copy packages having build scripts into a project-local cache so that multiple projects with multiple dependency trees don't use the same build artifacts. So what's the problem with so-called \"soft links\"?</p>\n<p>Soft links are when the package manager doesn't own the package source. An example is a workspace, or a dependency referenced through the <code>portal:</code> specifier. In these instances Yarn cannot safely assume that executing build scripts there is the intended behavior, because it would likely involve mutating your project or, even worse, an external location on your disk that might be shared by multiple projects. Since Yarn avoids doing anything unsafe, it cannot run build scripts on soft links.</p>\n<p>There are a few workarounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Using <code>file:</code> instead of <code>portal:</code> will cause a hard link to be used instead of a soft link. The other side of the coin will be that the packages will be copied into the cache as well, meaning that changing the package source will require you to run <code>YARN_UPDATE_FILE_CACHE=1 yarn install</code> for your changes to be taken into account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can manually run <code>yarn run postinstall</code> (or whatever is named your build script) from the directory of the affected packages. This requires you to know in which order they'll have to be called, but is generally the safest option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can simply abstain from using build scripts with soft links. While this suggestion might seem like a bad case of \"fix a problem by not encountering the problem\", consider that build scripts in development might not be of the best effect from a developer experience perspective - they usually mean that you'll need to run a script before being able to see your changes, which is often not what you seek.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"yn0007---must_build\"><a href=\"#yn0007---must_build\" aria-label=\"yn0007   must_build permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>YN0007 - <code>MUST_BUILD</code></h2>\n<p>A package must be built.</p>\n<p>This informational message occurs when Yarn wishes to let you know that a package will need to be built in order for the installation to complete.
