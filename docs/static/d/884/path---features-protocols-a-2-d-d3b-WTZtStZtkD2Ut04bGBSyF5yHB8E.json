Because such destination folders typically don't contain <code>package.json</code>, the <code>link:</code> protocol doesn't use them at all. It can cause issues when you want to link to a different <em>package</em> on the disk (similar to what <code>yarn link</code> does), because then the transitive dependencies aren't resolved.</p>\n<p>In order to solve this use case, we designed the <code>portal:</code> protocol which opens a portal to a package located on your disk. Because portals know that they only target packages, they're able to properly resolve transitive dependencies. And thanks to PnP, they even work as you would expect with peer dependencies!</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/features/protocols","title":"Protocols"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"features"}}
