In a major step forward, Yarn got redesigned in the v2 in order to leverage a new modular API that can be extended through plugins. Nowadays, most of our features are implemented through those plugins - even <code>yarn add</code> and <code>yarn install</code> are preinstalled plugins!</p>\n<h2>What can plugins do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plugins can add new resolvers.</strong> Resolvers are the components tasked from converting dependency ranges (for example <code>^1.2.0</code>) into fully-qualified package references (for example <code>npm:1.2.0</code>). By implementing a resolver, you can tell Yarn which versions are valid candidates to a specific range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plugins can add new fetchers.</strong> Fetchers are the components that take the fully-qualified package references we mentioned in the previous step (for example <code>npm:1.2.0</code>) and know how to obtain the data of the package they belong to. Fetchers can work with remote packages (for example the npm registry), but can also find the packages directly from their location on the disk (or any other data source).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plugins can add new linkers.</strong> Once all the packages have been located and are ready for installation, Yarn will call the linkers to generate the files needed for the install targets to work properly. As an example, the PnP linker would generate the <code>.pnp.js</code> manifest, and a Python linker would instead generate the virtualenv files needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plugins can add new commands.</strong> Each plugin can ship as many commands as they see fit, which will be injected into our CLI (also making them available through <code>yarn --help</code>). Because the Yarn plugins are dynamically linked with the running Yarn process, they can be very small and guaranteed to share the exact same behavior as your package manager (which wouldn't be the case if you were to reimplement the workspace detection, for example).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to use plugins?</h2>\n<p>Plugins are single-file JS scripts built via the <code>@berry/builder</code> tools. They are relatively easy to use (we plan to improve it even more by wrapping the process within a CLI command):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Download the plugin you want to use and put it somewhere within your project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update your project-level <code>.yarnrc</code> file by adding the following property:</p>\n<pre><code>plugins:\n  - \"./my-plugin.js\"\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that's it! The next time you'll start Yarn, your plugin will be injected into the environment.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/features/plugins","title":"Plugins"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"features"}}
