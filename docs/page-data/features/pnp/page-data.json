In this context, Node didn't have to know the first thing about what a \"package\" was: it only reasoned in terms of files. \"Does this file exists here? No? Let's look in the parent <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code> then. Does it exists here? Still no? Too bad...\", and it kept going until it found the right one. This process was vastly inefficient, and for a lot of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code> directories typically contained gargantuan amounts of files. Generating them could make up for more than 70% of the time needed to run <code class=\"language-text\">yarn install</code>. Even having preexisting installations wouldn't save you, as package managers still had to diff the existing <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code> with what it should have beeen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Because the <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code> generation was an I/O-heavy operation, package managers didn't have a lot of leeway to optimize it much further than just doing a simple file copy - and even though we could have used hardlinks or copy-on-write when possible, we would still have needed to diff the current state of the filesystem before making a bunch of syscalls to manipulate the disk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Because Node had no concept of package, it didn't know either whether a file was <em>meant</em> to be accessed (versus being available by the sheer virtue of hoisting). It was entirely possible that the code you wrote worked one day in development but broke later in production because you forgot to list one of your dependencies in your <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even at runtime, the Node resolution had to make a bunch of <code class=\"language-text\">stat</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">readdir</code> calls in order to figure out from where to load every single required file. It was extremely wasteful, and was part of why booting Node applications took so much time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, the very design of the <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code> folder was impractical in that it didn't allow package managers to properly dedupe packages. Even though some algorithms could be employed to optimize the tree layout (hoisting), we still ended up unable to optimize some particular patterns - causing not only the disk usage to be higher than needed, but also some packages to be instantiated multiple times in memory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fixing-node_modules\"><a href=\"#fixing-node_modules\" aria-label=\"fixing node_modules permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fixing node_modules</h2>\n<p>When you think about it, Yarn already knows everything about your dependency tree - after all it even installs it on the disk for you. So the question becomes: why do we let it to Node to locate the packages? Why didn't we simply tell Node where to find them, and inform it that any require call to X by Y was meant to access the files from a specific set of dependencies? This is from this postulate that Plug'n'Play was created.</p>\n<p>In this install mode (now the default starting from Yarn v2), Yarn generates a single <code class=\"language-text\">.pnp.js</code> file instead of the usual <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code>. Instead of containing the source code of the installed packages, the <code class=\"language-text\">.pnp.js</code> file contains a map linking a package name and version to a location on the disk, and another map linking a package name and version to its set of dependencies. Thanks to this efficient system, Node can directly know where to look for files being required - regardless who asks for them!</p>\n<p>This approach as various benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Since we only need to generate a single text file instead of tens of thousands, installs are now pretty much instantaneous - the main bottleneck becomes the number of dependencies in your project rather than your disk performances.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our installs are made stabler, as I/O operations are prone to fail (like on Windows, where writing and removing files in batch may trigger various unintended interactions with Windows Defender and similar tools).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since we aren't supported by a filesystem hierarchy anymore we can guarantee not only a perfect optimization of the dependency tree (aka perfect hoisting), but also predictable package instantiations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The generated file can be checked within your repository as part of the <a href=\"/berry/features/zero-installs\">Zero-Installs</a> effort, removing the need to run <code class=\"language-text\">yarn install</code> in the first place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your applications start faster, because the Node resolution doesn't have to iterate over the filesystem hierarchy nearly as much as before (and soon won't have to do it at all!).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"caveats-and-work-in-progress\"><a href=\"#caveats-and-work-in-progress\" aria-label=\"caveats and work in progress permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Caveats and work-in-progress</h2>\n<p>During the years that led to Plug'n'Play being designed and adopted as main install strategy, various projects came up with their own implementation of the Node Resolution Algorithm - usually to circumvent shortcomings of the <code class=\"language-text\">require.resolve</code> API.
