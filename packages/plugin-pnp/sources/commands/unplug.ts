  .detail(`
    This command will add the specified selectors to the list of packages that must be unplugged when installed.

    A package being unplugged means that instead of being referenced directly through its archive, it will be unpacked at install time in the directory configured via \`virtualFolder\`.

    Unpacking a package isn't advised as a general tool because it makes it harder to store your packages within the repository. However, it's a good approach to quickly and safely debug some packages, and can even sometimes be required depending on the context (for example when the package contains shellscripts).

    The unplug command sets a flag that's persisted in your top-level \`package.json\` through the \`dependenciesMeta\` field. As such, to undo its effects, just revert the changes made to the manifest and run \`yarn install\`.

    `Unplug lodash`,
