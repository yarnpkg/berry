const getMessage = (configuration: Configuration) => `
${configuration.format(`Welcome on Yarn 2!`, `bold`)} ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for helping us shape our vision of how projects
should be managed going forward.

Being still in RC, Yarn 2 isn't completely stable yet. Some features might be
missing, and some behaviors may have received major overhaul. In case of doubt,
use the following URLs to get some insight:

  - The changelog:
    ${configuration.format(`https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/tree/CHANGELOG.md`, `cyan`)}

  - Our issue tracker:
    ${configuration.format(`https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry`, `cyan`)}

  - Our Discord server:
    ${configuration.format(`https://discord.gg/yarnpkg`, `cyan`)}

We're hoping you will enjoy the experience. For now, a good start is to run
the two following commands:

  ${configuration.format(`find . -name node_modules -prune -exec rm -r {} \\;`, `magenta`)}
  ${configuration.format(`yarn install`, `magenta`)}

One last trick! If you need at some point to upgrade Yarn to a nightly build,
the following command will install the CLI straight from master:

  ${configuration.format(`yarn set version from sources`, `magenta`)}

See you later ðŸ‘‹
`;

export class WelcomeCommand extends BaseCommand {
  @Command.Path(`--welcome`)
  async execute() {
    const configuration = await Configuration.find(this.context.cwd, this.context.plugins);
    this.context.stdout.write(`${getMessage(configuration).trim()}\n`);
  }
}
