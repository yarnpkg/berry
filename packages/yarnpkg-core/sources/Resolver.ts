/**
 * Resolvers are the components that do all the lifting needed in order to
 * produce a lockfile. In clear, they transfom the following:
 *
 *   webpack@^4.0.0
 *
 * into this:
 *
 *   webpack@4.28.0 | dependencies: ajv@^6.1.0, ajv-keyword@^3.1.0, ...
 *
 * In order to do this, they have three different data structures used to
 * represents the various states of the package resolution:
 *
 *   - **Descriptors** contain a package name and a range (for example, using
 *     the previous example, "^4.0.0" would be the range). This range might
 *     point to multiple possible resolutions, so a descriptor alone isn't
 *     enough to fetch the package data from its remote location.
 *
 *   - **Locators** contain a package name and a reference that is used to
 *     both uniquely identify a package and fetch it from its remote location.
 *     To keep using the same example, "4.28.0" would be the reference. Note
 *     that locators have a funny property: they also are valid descriptors!
 *
 *   - **Packages** are locators that made it big. While locators are quite
 *     small, package definitions are relatively fat and contain much more
 *     information than their cousins - for example the dependency list of the
 *     package.
