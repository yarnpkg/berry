  "description": "Yarnrc files (named this way because they must be called `.yarnrc.yml`) are the one place where you'll be able to configure Yarn's internal settings. While Yarn will automatically find them in the parent directories, they should usually be kept at the root of your project (often your repository). Starting from the v2, they **must** be written in valid Yaml and have the right extension (simply calling your file `.yarnrc` won't do).\n\nEnvironment variables can be accessed from setting definitions by using the `${NAME}` syntax when defining the values. By default Yarn will require the variables to be present, but this can be turned off by using either `${NAME-fallback}` (which will return `fallback` if `NAME` isn't set) or `${NAME:-fallback}` (which will return `fallback` if `NAME` isn't set, or is an empty string).\n\nFinally, note that most settings can also be defined through environment variables (at least for the simpler ones; arrays and objects aren't supported yet). To do this, just prefix the names and write them in snake case: `YARN_CACHE_FOLDER` will set the cache folder (such values will overwrite any that might have been defined in the RC files - use them sparingly).",
