Packages in Yarn follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), also known as "semver". When you install a new package from the registry it will be added to your [`package.json`](/configuration/manifest) with a semver version range.

These versions are broken down into `major.minor.patch` and looks like one of these: `3.14.1`, `0.42.0,` `2.7.18`. Each part of the version gets incremented at various times:

- Increment `major` when you make a **breaking** or **incompatible** change to the API of a package.
- Increment `minor` when you add **new functionality** while staying **backwards-compatible**.
- Increment `patch` when you make **bug fixes** while staying **backwards-compatible**.

> **Note:** there are also sometimes "labels" or "extensions" to the semver format that mark things like pre-releases or betas (e.g. `2.0.0-beta.3`).

When developers talk about two semver versions being "compatible" with one another they are referring to the **backwards-compatible** changes (`minor` and `patch`).

## Version ranges

When you want to specify a dependency you specify its name and a **version range** in your `package.json` like one of these:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "package-1": ">=2.0.0 <3.1.4",
    "package-2": "^0.4.2",
    "package-3": "~2.7.1"
  }
}
```

Youâ€™ll notice that we have a bunch of characters separate from the version. These characters, `>=`, `<`, `^`, and `~`, are **operators** and they are used to specify **version ranges**.

The purpose of a version range is to specify which versions of a dependency will work for your code.

### Comparators

Each version range is made up of **comparators**. These comparators are simply an _operator_ followed by a _version_. Here are some of the basic operators:

| Comparator | Description                                             |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<2.0.0`   | Any version that is _**less than**_ `2.0.0`             |
| `<=3.1.4`  | Any version that is _**less or equal than**_ `3.1.4`    |
| `>0.4.2`   | Any version that is _**greater than**_ `0.4.2`          |
| `>=2.7.1`  | Any version that is _**greater or equal than**_ `2.7.1` |
| `=4.6.6`   | Any version that is _**equal to**_ `4.6.6`              |

> **Note:** if  no operator is specified, then `=` is assumed in the version range. So the `=` operator is effectively optional.

### Intersections

Comparators can be joined by whitespace to create a **comparator set**. This creates an **intersection** of the comparators it includes. For example, the comparator set `>=2.0.0 <3.1.4` means _"Greater than or equal to `2.0.0` **and** less than `3.1.4`"_.

### Unions

A full version range can include a **union** of multiple comparator sets joined together by `||`. If either side of the union is satisfied, then the whole version range is satisfied. For example, the version range `<2.0.0 || >3.1.4` means _"Less than 2.0.0 **or** greater than 3.1.4"_.

### Pre-release tags

Versions can also have **pre-release tags** (e.g. `3.1.4-beta.2`). If a comparator includes a version with a pre-release tag it will only match against versions that have the same `major.minor.patch` version.

For example, the range `>=3.1.4-beta.2` would match `3.1.4-beta.2` or `3.1.4-beta.12`, but would not match `3.1.5-beta.1` even though it is _technically_ "greater than or equal to" (`>=`) the `3.1.4-beta.2` version.

Pre-releases tend to contain accidental breaking changes and usually you do not want to match pre-releases outside of the version you have specified so this behavior is useful.

### Advanced version ranges

#### Hyphen ranges

Hyphen ranges (e.g. `2.0.0 - 3.1.4`) specify an _inclusive_ set. If part of the version is left out (e.g. `0.4 or 2`) then they are filled in with zeroes.

| Version range   | Expanded version range |
| :-------------- | :--------------------- |
| `2.0.0 - 3.1.4` | `>=2.0.0 <=3.1.4`      |
| `0.4 - 2`       | `>=0.4.0 <=2.0.0`      |

#### X ranges

Any of `X`, `x`, or `*` can be used to leave part or all of a version unspecified.

| Version range             | Expanded version range      |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| ``` `` ``` (empty string) | `*` or `>=0.0.0`            |
| `2`                       | `2.x.x` or `>=2.0.0 <3.0.0` |
| `3.1`                     | `3.1.x` or `>=3.1.0 <3.2.0` |

#### Tilde ranges

Using `~` with a minor version specified allows `patch` changes. Using `~` with only major version specified will allow `minor` changes.

| Version range | Expanded version range      |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- |
| `~3.1.4`      | `>=3.1.4 <3.2.0`            |
| `~3.1`        | `3.1.x` or `>=3.1.0 <3.2.0` |
| `~3`          | `3.x` or `>=3.0.0 <4.0.0`   |

> **Note:** specifying pre-releases in tilde ranges will only match pre-releases in that same full version. For example, the version range `~3.1.4-beta.2` would match against `3.1.4-beta.4` but not `3.1.5-beta.2` because the `major.minor.patch` version is different.

#### Caret ranges

Allow changes that do not modify the first non-zero digit in the version, either the `3` in `3.1.4` or the `4` in `0.4.2`.

| Version range | Expanded version range |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| `^3.1.4`      | `>=3.1.4 <4.0.0`       |
| `^0.4.2`      | `>=0.4.2 <0.5.0`       |
| `^0.0.2`      | `>=0.0.2 <0.0.3`       |

> **Note:** by default when you run `yarn add [package-name]` it will use a caret range. You can change this behavior by updating [`defaultSemverRangePrefix`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#defaultSemverRangePrefix).

If part of the version is left out, the missing parts are filled in with zeroes. However, they will still allow for that value to be changed.

| Version range | Expanded version range |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| `^0.0.x`      | `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`       |
| `^0.0`        | `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`       |
| `^0.x`        | `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`       |
| `^0`          | `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`       |
