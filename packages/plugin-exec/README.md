# `@yarnpkg/plugin-exec`

This plugin will add support to Yarn for the `exec:` protocol. This protocol is special in that it'll instruct Yarn to execute the specified Node script and use its output as package content (thus treating the script as a kind of package factory).

## Install

```
yarn plugin import exec
```
