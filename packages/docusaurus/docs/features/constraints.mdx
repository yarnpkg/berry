description: An in-depth guide to Yarn's constraints, a feature that provides an easy way to enforce common rules across a project.

:::info
This page documents the new JavaScript-based constraints. The older constraints, based on Prolog, are still supported but should be considered deprecated. Their documentation can be found [here](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/features/constraints).
:::

## Overview

Constraints allow enforcement of rules across [workspace](/features/workspaces) packages. For example, these rules might include the following:

* Ensuring the same version of dependencies across packages.
* Prohibiting the use of specific dependencies in packages.

## What can we enforce?

Our constraint engine currently supports two main targets:

- Workspace dependencies
- Arbitrary package.json fields

It currently doesn't support the following, but might in the future (PRs welcome!):

- Transitive dependencies
- Project structure

## Creating a constraint

Constraints are created by adding a `yarn.config.cjs` file at the root of your project (repository). This file should export an object with a `constraints` method. This method will be called by the constraints engine, and must define the rules to enforce on the project, using the provided API.

For example, the following `yarn.config.cjs` will enforce that all `react` dependencies are set to `18.0.0`.

```ts
module.exports = {
  async constraints({Yarn}) {
    for (const dep of Yarn.dependencies({ ident: 'react' })) {
      dep.update(`18.0.0`);
    }
  },
};
```

And the following will enforce that the `engines.node` field is properly set in all workspaces:

```ts
module.exports = {
  async constraints({Yarn}) {
    for (const workspace of Yarn.workspaces()) {
      workspace.set('engines.node', `20.0.0`);
    }
  },
};
```

## Declarative model

As much as possible, constraints are defined using a declarative model: you declare what the expected state should be, and Yarn checks whether it matches the reality or not. If it doesn't, Yarn will either throw an error (when calling `yarn constraints` without arguments), or attempt to automatically fix the issue (when calling `yarn constraints --fix`).

Because of this declarative model, you don't need to check the actual values yourself. For instance, the `if` condition here is extraneous and should be removed:

```ts
module.exports = {
  async constraints({Yarn}) {
    for (const dep of Yarn.dependencies({ ident: 'ts-node' })) {
      // No need to check for the actual value! Just always call `update`.
      if (dep.range !== `18.0.0`) {
        dep.update(`18.0.0`);
      }
    }
  },
};
```

## TypeScript support

Yarn ships types that make it easier to write constraints. To use them, add the dependency to your project:

```
$ yarn add @yarnpkg/types
```

Then, in your `yarn.config.cjs` file, import the types, in particular the `defineConfig` function which automatically type the configuration methods:

```ts
/** @type {import('@yarnpkg/types')} */
const { defineConfig } = require('@yarnpkg/types');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  async constraints({Yarn}) {
    // `Yarn` is now well-typed âœ¨
  },
});
```

You can also retrieve the types manually, which can be useful if you extract some rules into helper functions:

```ts
/** @param {import('@yarnpkg/types').Yarn.Constraints.Workspace} dependency */
function expectMyCustomRule(dependency) {
  // ...
}
```

You can alias the types to make them a little easier to use:

```ts
/**
 * @typedef {import('@yarnpkg/types').Yarn.Constraints.Workspace} Workspace
 * @typedef {import('@yarnpkg/types').Yarn.Constraints.Dependency} Dependency
 */

/** @param {Workspace} dependency */
function expectMyCustomRule(dependency) {
  // ...
}
```

## Putting it all together

This section regroups a couple of constraint examples. We are thinking to provide some of them as builtin helpers later on, although they tend to often contain some logic unique to each team / company.

### Restrict dependencies between workspaces

This code ensures that no two workspaces in your project can list the same packages in their `dependencies` or `devDependencies` fields but with different associated references.

```ts
// @ts-check

/** @type {import('@yarnpkg/types')} */
const {defineConfig} = require(`@yarnpkg/types`);

/**
 * This rule will enforce that a workspace MUST depend on the same version of
 * a dependency as the one used by the other workspaces.
 * 
 * @param {Context} context
 */
function enforceConsistentDependenciesAcrossTheProject({Yarn}) {
  for (const dependency of Yarn.dependencies()) {
    if (dependency.type === `peerDependencies`)
      continue;

    for (const otherDependency of Yarn.dependencies({ident: dependency.ident})) {
      if (otherDependency.type === `peerDependencies`)
        continue;

      dependency.update(otherDependency.range);
    }
  }
}

module.exports = defineConfig({
  constraints: async ctx => {
    enforceConsistentDependenciesAcrossTheProject(ctx);
  },
});
```
