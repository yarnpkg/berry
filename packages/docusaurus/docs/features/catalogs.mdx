## Overview

Catalogs provide centralized dependency version management for workspaces. Inspired by [pnpm's catalog functionality](https://pnpm.io/catalogs), they allow you to define version ranges in your `.yarnrc.yml` and reference them across multiple `package.json` files using the `catalog:` protocol.

This eliminates version duplication, ensures consistency across packages, and makes dependency upgrades much simpler — update one place instead of many files.

:::info
The catalog plugin is included by default starting from Yarn 4.10.0.

### Basic usage

Define a catalog in your `.yarnrc.yml`:

```yaml
catalog:
  react: ^18.3.1
  lodash: ^4.17.21
```

Reference entries in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog:",
    "lodash": "catalog:"
  }
}
```

## Named catalogs

You can define multiple named catalogs using the `catalogs` field for different purposes:

```yaml
catalog:
  lodash: ^4.17.21

catalogs:
  react18:
    react: ^18.3.1
    react-dom: ^18.3.1
  react17:
    react: ^17.0.2
    react-dom: ^17.0.2
```

Reference named catalogs by specifying the name:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "catalog:",
    "react": "catalog:react18"
  }
}
```

## Publishing

When publishing packages, the `catalog:` protocol is automatically replaced with actual version ranges, ensuring compatibility with other package managers:

```json
// Source package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog:react18"
  }
}

// Published package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1"
  }
}
```

## Supported fields

The `catalog:` protocol works in `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`.
