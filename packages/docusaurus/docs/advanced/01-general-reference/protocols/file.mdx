description: How file dependencies work in Yarn.
---

The `file:` protocol fetches a package from a local path. This can be useful for testing packages locally before publishing them to the npm registry, or distributing a particular dependency without relying on the version from the npm registry.

```
yarn add my-pkg@file:./relative/path/to/dependency/folder
```

## Packing

:::warning
Unlike [`git:` dependencies](/protocol/git), the folder pointed to by `file:` is not packed before being imported in the project. This is something we'll likely fix in a future major version.

## Folder-based links

When `file:` points to a folder, Yarn will copy it rather than directly reference its sources. For the `node_modules` linker, it means that the content of the generated `node_modules` will be unique files, and that changes performed there won't affect the original source folder.

```
file:./relative/path/to/package.tgz
```

## Tarball-based links

When `file:` points to a `.tgz` file, Yarn will transparently let you require files from within the archive. For the `node_modules` linker, it means that the archive will be unpacked into the generated `node_modules` folder.

The `.tgz` file should have all the project files under a single top-level folder, and that folder should have a `package.json` file describing the package and its version.  For example, a package called `foo` might be
in a file named `foo-1.0.tgz`, the `tgz` could have files in it at `foo/package.json` and `foo/main.js`.  You would add it to your project with a command like `yarn add foo@file:./path/to/foo-1.0.tgz`.
