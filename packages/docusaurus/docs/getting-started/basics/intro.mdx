Yarn is an established open-source package manager used to manage dependencies in JavaScript projects. It assists with the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages dependencies, eventually helping you reach your objectives faster with fewer distractions.

Its areas of focus are speed, correctness, security, and developer experience, which we improve along every axis by leveraging a suite of innovative features such as workspaces, offline caching, parallel installs, hardened mode, interactive commands, and more.

Given its robust features and stellar track record, Yarn proves to be an indispensable asset to the JavaScript ecosystem, driving efficiency, security, and positive developer experience in projects of any size.

Unlike most other package managers, which typically defer to npm for non-install-related commands, Yarn reimplements all commands, so as to have full control over our developer experience and stability.
