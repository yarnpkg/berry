import {Inline as I, Command as C, Binary as B, Path as P} from '@site/src/components/CommandLineHighlight2.tsx'

If you're coming from npm, the main changes are:

- Running <I><C><B>yarn</B></C></I> is enough to run an install! It's an alias to `yarn install`.
- Adding or updating a dependency to a single package is done with `yarn add`.
- Upgrading a dependency across the whole project is done with `yarn up`.
- Your scripts are aliased. Calling `yarn build` is the same as `yarn run build`!
- Most registry-related commands are moved behind <I><C><B>yarn</B><P>npm</P></C></I> (ex: `yarn npm audit`).

To see the full list of commands, check the [CLI reference](/cli).
