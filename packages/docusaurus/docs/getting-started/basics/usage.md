If you're coming from npm, the main changes are:

- Running `yarn` is enough to run an install! It's an alias to `yarn install`.
- Adding or updating a dependency to a single package is done with `yarn add`.
- Upgrading a dependency across the whole project is done with `yarn up`.
- Your scripts are aliased. Calling `yarn build` is the same as `yarn run build`!
- Most registry-related commands are moved behind <CommandLineHighlight type={`inlineCode`} lines={[{type: `command`, command: {name: `yarn`, path: [`npm`], argv: [`npm`]}, split: false, tooltip: null, tokens: [{type: `path`, segmentIndex: 0, text: `npm`}]}]}/> (ex: `yarn npm audit`).

To see the full list of commands, check the [CLI reference](/cli).
