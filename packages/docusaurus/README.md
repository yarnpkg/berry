# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The `master` branch is automatically deployed to https://yarnpkg.com/ via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Pull Requests are also deployed as Deploy Previews.
